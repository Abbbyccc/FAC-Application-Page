            <h2>A little about me</h2>
            <hr id="hr1">
            <p>I came to the UK from Taiwan in 2013 and ever since then I have been working as a project manager mainly
                focused on the education training sector between the UK and China. And due to my interests, I also
                helped my companies to build and maintain websites which build up my interest in web development even
                more. I always have this thought to change my career to the tech industry but never be brave enough to
                do so, until the pandemic came which changed how the world’s running and showed how important technology
                is for the future. This is really a wake-up call to me, I finally made up my mind to change my career to
                become a web developer. I started to take HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from multiple platforms at end of
                2021 and I am fully ready to take another step with Founders & Coders to start my new journey!

            <h2>Why Founders & Coders ?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I have been self-learning basic coding skills but I find it struggle sometimes until my friend
                recommended FAC to me. When I was invited to join the Discord channel, I immediately love the
                friendly
                and supportive environment it provides. I feel more confident being surrounded by same-minded people
                who
                have the same interests, and goals which also reassured me that I am not alone and that there are
                many
                people who are choosing the same path as me. Most importantly, FAC provides peep to peer learning,
                project works, and apprenticeship opportunities all to train individuals to become more employable
                and
                provide a career path for students which is rare compared to normal pricey Bootcamps. I also like
                the
                learning style, I love to share my idea, help and discuss with each other and always be respectful.
                I
                believe FAC will provide the experience that I will never get by self-learning and be the best
                choice I
                made for my journey.
